One of the last rotations in my third year convinced me to forever change the direction of my life.When I completed my rotation in Obstetrics & Gynecology, I understood why my dad enjoyed his career so much.After that wonderful experience, I applied to various OB/GYN residencies around the country. My desire, however, was to move back to California.Ten days before I was to marry my wife, I learned that I had been accepted to Los Angeles County / USC Medical Center which meant four years of grueling residency training.Thankfully, she still married me.I have been in practice in this area since 1994.I started in a partnership, and moved into a group practice.After listening to patients who liked the care but didnt like the big office atmosphere, my partners and I decided to divide the big group into 3 individual practices.In this way, our relationships with our patients would be improved and the office less hectic.I believe this change to have been a great benefit to our patients, and to our own families.Although my practice is very busy, I try my hardest to give all of my patients the time that they really need.Unfortunately, this often causes me to run late.But sometimes comforting a woman recently diagnosed with a miscarriage or explaining what a womans prognosis is upon hearing of a newly diagnosed cancer takes longer than the typical amount of time in a routine time slot. Not all things encountered during routine exams are expected.The important thing is to provide what a patient needs.The basis of my treatment and recommendations for the women I see in my practice is a blend of two things. The first is based on what I have learned as a physician in the study of medicine.The second and probably most important is related to my thoughts of based on what I know as a physician, what would I want for my wife, my daughter, or my mother if she were in this situation?Medical School:Louisiana State Universityin Baton RougeResidency:Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center in CaliforniaJohn Muir Health Walnut Creek Medical CenterJohn Muir Health Concord Medical Center","Medical School:Louisiana State Universityin Baton Rouge, Residency:Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center in California","John Muir Health Walnut Creek Medical Center, John Muir Health Concord Medical Center",Obstetrics and Gynecology,"Walnut Creek 110 Tampico Suite 220 Walnut Creek, CA 94598 Ph: 925-935-5356 Fx: 925-935-1070",www.stephenwellsmd.com

Though I was always certain I would pursue a career in healthcare, I grappled with the decision of whether to pursue a path in medicine, public health or social work. After graduation I worked for the UNC AIDS Clinical Trials Unit and volunteered as an Emergency Medical Technician. During this time I was surrounded and mentored by HIV nurses and nurse practitioners who were so compassionate and creative in figuring out how to meet their patients needs and flight nurses who were unflappable in the worst of circumstances and I began to see nursing as the perfect combination of the three fields. I attended Georgetown Universitys accelerated nursing program and then moved to Seattle, where I worked as a Cardiothoracic ICU nurse for 5 years. My time in the ICU was filled with dramatic highs and lows and it was a job I loved for the relationships I was able to cultivate with patients and their families and the amazing collaboration and camaraderie among the ICU team. It was a time of genuine teamwork at its best and it taught me what it means to truly care for people well.I chose to return to graduate school to become a nurse practitioner because of the joy I find in building relationships with patients and their families and working with them to improve their health and wellness. I attended the University of Washington and received my Doctorate of Nursing Practice as a Family Nurse Practitioner. Since I became a nurse practitioner, I have worked as a research coordinator for HIV clinical trials, cared for patients living with HIV and, most recently, worked in a community health clinic in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco.Through my diverse experience, caring for women throughout the lifespan has persisted as a professional passion and highlight. In my initial conversation with Dr. Wells, we shared stories of the medical mission trips weve each taken to Haiti, bonding over similar tales of caring for patients in immense heat with limited resources. It was immediately apparent that our patient care philosophies and values are aligned and I was thrilled to accept the opportunity to join this wonderful practice. My approach to patient care is thoughtful, intentional and focused to ensure you are heard, respected and receive the care you need and deserve.

From a very early age I always knew that I wanted to work in Womens Health. I blame it on my mother taking me to a young girls and their changing bodies class at probably a too young of an age, but am so thankful for it.I always saw the benefit in women having the opportunity to educate themselves about their bodies and health. In high school, my junior and senior year, I voluntarily gave up my free period and asked to help teach the Freshmen Health Ed Class.In college, I continued to look for ways to expand my knowledge and discover my love for medicine and health education. I attended Washington University in Saint Louis for undergraduate and worked as a campus EMT and a patient educator at Planned Parenthood.After college, while working for the Red Cross, I knew that Womens health was my calling and explored all my options of how to incorporate it in my life. Having been on a pre-med track, I had never really considered being a nurse practitioner, or, like many, heard of a midwife.It was not until I learned what a certified nurse midwife is, that I knew it was what I was meant to do. I discovered a career that would end up being the best decision of my life. I found a way in which I would be able to combine my passion for medicine, science and health, while getting to incorporate patient education.I moved to New York City to pursue my midwifery studies. I attended Columbia University where I obtained my second bachelors in nursing and my masters in Midwifery. Upon graduating, I took a position at Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, NY. This busy city hospital gave me more experiences than I could have ever dreamed of. Talk about being thrown into the deep end of the pool! But I loved every second of it. I had the chance to work with people of many different backgrounds and many different levels of care. In my three and a half years there, I had the opportunity to delivery some of my patients second and even third babies, while on other days, I had deliveries in the hospital lobby of people walking in off the street with no prenatal care and denying they were pregnant. It was an amazing place.However, after seven years in New York, I felt it was time to come back home and be closer to my family. I was blessed enough to cross paths with Dr Wells in the most unexpected way- on FaceTime! My sister was delivering her second baby and I missed flying out for it by a day. But not wanting to miss out, or be there for her, I was able to participate via the wonders of technology. After chatting with Dr Wells during her delivery, I then met him the next day in Postpartum and we hit it off. I learned more about the practice and philosophy and knew it would be a great fit. A few months later, I found myself back on the west coast and joining an incredible practice.I love that I am now in a place where I can provide each patient with, literally, the care I would want for my sister. I aim to provide an environment that is supportive and relaxed, and where one feels that all their concerns are heard and their questions answered. I pride myself on educating my patients, so they can be active participants in their care.I feel blessed that I truly love what I do. I get to be a part of such a joyous and life-changing event in so many peoples lives. Getting to be present in that moment, when a patient goes from being a woman, to being a mom, is something I treasure on a daily basis.Bachelor Degree: NursingWashington University in Saint LouisColumbia University in New YorkMasters Degree: MidwiferyColumbia University in New York","Bachelor Degree: NursingWashington University in Saint Louis, Columbia University in New York, Masters Degree: MidwiferyColumbia University in New York",,"Midwife, Obstetrics and Gynecology","Walnut Creek 110 Tampico Suite 220 Walnut Creek, CA 94598 Ph: 925-935-5356 Fx: 925-935-1070",www.stephenwellsmd.com

I grew up English/Spanish bilingual and it opened up my world to travel, study, and a passion to work with diverse communities across the globe. I graduated from Berkeley High School and then attended Long Island Universitys Friends World Program, where I spent the next three out of four years of my undergraduate education in various parts of the world. In my sophomore year of college, I studied in Costa Rica and traveled throughout Central America with a focus in social work. I spent the first part of my junior year in London before being lured back to Costa Ricas tropical humidity. I then spent a summer in Accra, Ghana, volunteering in a Maternity Clinic. It was during this time that I finally realized that my true calling was to be a midwife. I felt I could make a difference by attending to women and their families during the precious time of pregnancy and childbirth. I learned that I wanted to give women the attention, love, respect and high quality care they deserve during pregnancy and childbirth; free of judgment and full of compassion and responsible care.I graduated from the UCSF Masters in Nursing and Midwifery program in 2008. During my clinical rotations as a student and past employment in the medical field, I have worked in a variety of settings with diverse populations of women and their families. I have always made it a priority that every woman receives the care they deserve. I also aim to support women and their families in having a positive experience with pregnancy and the birth process. It has always been a priority to me to listen to my patients, to be fully present, and to empower them to make healthy choices while being active participants in their care.I worked for two years at La Clinica de la Raza in Vallejo and then moved with my family to Tucson, Arizona, where I practiced for over three years as a full-scope midwife. In those three years, I delivered nearly 400 babies! The Bay Area has always been our true home, and my husband and I knew that this is the place we want to raise our three daughters. We are thrilled to be back!I am so happy to have found Dr. Wells and to be able to bring my unique personal and professional experiences to this vibrant practice.

After graduating high-school, I attended Pepperdine University in beautiful Malibu, California and received my Bachelors of Science in Sports Medicine, with a pre-med emphasis. I always knew, even as a child, I wanted a career in the medical field. However, it was not until after graduation, and a lot of research and soul-searching, that I realized I wanted to become a nurse practitioner.After reading about the profession and having wonderful experiences with nurse practitioners as a patient, I realized this was the perfect career for me. It would afford me both the opportunity to provide comprehensive, high-quality medical care, and the flexibility to live a happy and fulfilling family life. As much as I love what I do, there is nothing I love more then spending time with my husband and our wonderful little girl.With this new career path in mind, I began a nursing program at Samuel Merritt University in Oakland. It was during my RN rotations that I fell in love with Labor and Delivery. There is nothing more gratifying then being with and providing care to people during one of the most exciting, memorable, emotional and life-changing experiences they will ever have- becoming a parent. After graduating from nursing school in 2006, I was fortunate enough to receive a job offer in Labor and Delivery at John Muir. It is because of the love of what I do that I am still working there as a Labor and Delivery Nurse 3 days a week.While working in labor and delivery, I began a nurse practitioner program, and three years later received my Masters of Science in Nursing as a Family Nurse Practitioner. With my L&D experience I chose to focus my clinical training in Obstetrics and Gynecology, which has led me to where I am today. I enjoy working in an OBGYN practice because it allows me to work with women of all ages, through many pivotal times in their lives, such as adolescence, pregnancy, menopause and beyond. It also allows me to form more lasting relationships with my patients and follow them throughout the course of their lives. I especially love when I get to see a couple throughout their pregnancy and then have the opportunity to care for them during their labor and delivery experience.I feel so fortunate to have joined this wonderful practice, which is committed to providing the highest quality patient care in a kind and compassionate manner. It is my goal that my patients will feel comfortable discussing their questions and concerns, and leave feeling confident in and satisfied with the care they received.Medical School: Nursing ProgramSamuel Merritt University in Oakland, CaliforniaUndergraduate:Bachelors of Science in Sports MedicineI attended Pepperdine University in Malibu, California","Medical School: Nursing ProgramSamuel Merritt University in Oakland, California, Undergraduate:Bachelors of Science in Sports MedicineI attended Pepperdine University in Malibu, California",,"Nurse Practitioner, Obstetrics and Gynecology","Walnut Creek 110 Tampico Suite 220 Walnut Creek, CA 94598 Ph: 925-935-5356 Fx: 925-935-1070",www.stephenwellsmd.com
